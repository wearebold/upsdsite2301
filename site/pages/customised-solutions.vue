              Off the shelf UPS’s are designed for use within a climate
              controlled environment such as an office or server room. The
              reason:- UPS systems are unique in that they combine both
              micro-electronics and high power components in a single cabinet.
            </p>

            <p>
              Even microscopic amounts of conductive dust or even excessive
              humidity can cause a flashover within the UPS, cutting the power
              to your sensitive electronic equipment, triggering downtime and a
              costly repair. Add to this the degrading effect that raised
              temperature has on battery life (every 10C above the recommended
              20C operating temperature halves the battery’s life) and running
              the costs for an ‘off the shelf’ UPS can be astronomical.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not all environments are suited to the installation of a UPS,
              however we have the knowledge and capability to design and build
              ruggedised solutions for the harshest of environments. Every harsh
              environment has its own peculiarities that would cause standard
              ‘off the shelf’ equipment to fail, therefore we carry out a full
              assessment of your requirements and work with you to engineer a
              solution.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our extensive work with several Formula One Racing Teams has
              provided them with systems that have travelled the world and
              worked without fail for over five seasons. Before UPS Direct
              became involved in the sport, ‘off the shelf’ systems would
              literally explode on a weekly basis, and during one Chinese Grand
              Prix, a team replaced 13 UPS’s due to failures.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our customised solutions are also used in various manufacturing
              plants ranging from yoghurt production to egg packaging to
              aircraft braking systems test rigs.
