                <p class="text-h5">All UPS's rely on an internal battery. Like any other battery, it is a consumable item which will demonstrate its health (or lack of) when it is put into use.</p>
                <p>This is invariably at the instant a mains power problem occurs i.e. the battery is placed under instantaneous load conditions, and it will either support the system, or drop the load.</p>
                <p>Most UPS batteries have a five-year design life. This is calculated assuming the ambient room temperature is 20C. For every 10C the temperature rises, the battery life is halved.</p>
                <p>UPS systems rely on multiple batteries connected in a string. However, no matter how many healthy batteries are in the string, just one single battery failure will break the link, and drop your load!</p>
                <p>While it is impossible to accurately predict a system failure, maintenance will reduce and pre-empt most breakdowns.</p>
                <p>The only fail-safe method of guaranteeing your UPS will work when called upon is to carry out a maintenance check at least once a year.</p>
