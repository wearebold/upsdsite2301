Maintenance

#details
<p>Like any other computer peripheral, reliability and efficiency is directly linked to maintenance. The only difference is that the failure of most peripheral devices is usually only an annoyance.....the failure of your UPS can replicate the one disaster it was intended to prevent.</p>

<p>We offer a range of maintenance contracts designed to suit your needs. We will advise you of the relevant maintenance requirements for your system(s), and compile a maintenance package tailored to your specific requirements and budget.</p>

<p>In addition, we can offer 'total' maintenance contracts for the whole of your installation. This service is available for most equipment, whether installed by us, or by others. We can offer a more cost effective and thorough solution, because we assess your site as a whole and can identify potential imbalances between equipment types before they occur.

Battery Servicing

#details
<p>All UPS's rely on an internal battery. Like any other battery, it is a consumable item which will demonstrate its health (or lack of) when it is put into use.</p>

<p>This is invariably at the instant a mains power problem occurs i.e. the battery is placed under instantaneous load conditions, and it will either support the system, or drop the load.</p>

<p>Most UPS batteries have a five-year design life. This is calculated assuming the ambient room temperature is 20C. For every 10C the temperature rises, the battery life is halved.</p>

<p>UPS systems rely on multiple batteries connected in a string. However, no matter how many healthy batteries are in the string, just one single battery failure will break the link, and drop your load!</p>

<p>While it is impossible to accurately predict a system failure, maintenance will reduce and pre-empt most breakdowns.</p>

<p>The only fail-safe method of guaranteeing your UPS will work when called upon is to carry out a maintenance check at least once a year.</p>
